# Odin-RockPaperScissors
This is a student project from The Odin Project's curriculum to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was made in 2 stages; an initial console-only version and then a re-visit to add a UI. In the application, players face off with the computer in a 5-round game of the good 'ol classic game of rock, paper, scissors.
