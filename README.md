# Odin-RockPaperScissors
This is a student project to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using javascript and the index.html site's javascript console - no fancy bells or whistles yet! Instead of just being played through the console(this code is to be used for a more advanced project later), I decided to use alert windows to make it a little more user-friendly until we revisit this code in a later project.
